*****Description**

The primary purppose of this project is to have traces running in background so they can be assessed if needed.

Need to add a way to archive traces so the root dir only show the traces of the last 24 hours. Also a good idea to delete traces after a certain amount of time

- [x] Add trace
- [x] Configurable file rotation
- [ ] Add configurable archiving
- [] Add GUI
